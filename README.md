# Cloak-of-Invisibility
A project using Open CV to mimic the cloak of invisibility of harry potter.

<h3>step: 1</h3> -> firstly run the first file (background capture.py) and then press "q", this will capture the background image and will store that image in same folder.
            (make sure you are not in background,capture while you are not in the frame.)

<h3>step: 2</h3> -> Now, run the second file (invisible.py) , now use a red* cloth or object the see the magic.

* red: I used red color for the cloak, you can use any color of your choice,  but for this u just need to modify some code in "invisible.py", firstly add your color BGR value and then set lower and upper hue value as per your choice of color. Enjoy!
